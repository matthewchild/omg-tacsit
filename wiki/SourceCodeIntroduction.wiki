#summary A brief introduction into the organization of the source code

This implementation of the standard is written in Java. The project was created using NetBeans.

The source code is broken into three separate projects:

  # "spec" - The specification as defined by OMG.
  # "reference" - An abstract reference implementation which provides common implementations of some specification interfaces.
  # "worldwind" - A full implementation of the standard using Worldwind. This implementation leverages the reference implementation.
